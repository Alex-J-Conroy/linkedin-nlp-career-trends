My passion is bringing great people together to develop solutions enabling businesses to grow.

I am in direct exposure to the market and understand the challenges and what solutions effectively work. I can leverage a wealth of knowledge, experts and multiple technologies to provide vendor agnostic recommendations for the best interest of my customers.

We deliver scalable projects and consistently convince new enterprise and government organisations to work with us. In 2020, Datacom have created 2000 jobs in a call center to inform the community about Covid-19.

With over 6,200 people, and annual revenues of over $1.3 billion, Datacom is one of Australasia’s largest professional IT services companies. See some of Datacom’s partnerships with leading organisations in all types of industries: https://datacom.com/au/en/about-us/partners.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jadonfox/,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jadonfox/,"I love to help clients solve complex problems, make informed decisions and manage risk/strengthen controls in a structured, repeatable and transparent way using technology, data and innovative analytics including Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation. 

As a risk and compliance nerd and former actuary, I appreciate the power of AI including ML and other analytical techniques to uncover evidence from targeted analysis and value how these findings can provide additional context. Insightful analytics are enabled by effective data management practices and supported by strong data governance and data ethics programs which is often where we see some of the biggest gains in supporting our clients.  

In my role as the National Partner In Charge of KPMG Analytics & Data Management practice, I set strategy and work collaboratively across the firm with a diverse team of data scientists, technology and cloud specialists, data management experts and data engineers to deliver better client outcomes. 

What sets me apart is my depth of practical analytics experience across a range of industries, both in Australia and overseas. 

My clients tell me they like working with me because of my collaborative and highly transparent approach to working them. This ensures there are ‘no surprises’ at the end of a project. 

They also appreciate that I have their best interests at heart and that I strive to provide a balanced perspective to the decision-making process, even if it means taking a totally different direction in order to help them achieve their best possible outcome.

Specialties: Data and analytics methods, data & AI governance and strategy; fraud & financial crime risk management; information and data management; decision support; data and AI ethics; and advanced analytics use cases including Artificial Intelligence (i.e. machine learning, natural language processing (NLP) and GenAI).

I always welcome new perspectives and challenges, so contact me via LinkedIn or email (jadon.fox@gmail.com).","National Lead Partner, Analytics & Data Management helping our clients and communities build trust, transform and make a positive and sustainable impact with data & AI","Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQF5uCqr7aWfCQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627010162396?e=1723680000&v=beta&t=BqySR7qaKermsBv7jxFZAAAJ7DoYzkUW0A7pjvmJMds,Jadon,"Fox, CFE, CAMS","Jadon Fox, CFE, CAMS",1355,2nd,ACoAAAENBswBrqi6LNtNQCICqP4xL5_oBXJdbC4,17630924,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAAENBswBrqi6LNtNQCICqP4xL5_oBXJdbC4,name",1349,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAENBswBrqi6LNtNQCICqP4xL5_oBXJdbC4%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAAENBswBrqi6LNtNQCICqP4xL5_oBXJdbC4%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,true,false,false,KPMG Australia,https://www.linkedin.com/company/2639873/,National Partner In Charge - KPMG Analytics & Data Management,,"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",Jul 2022 - Present,2022-07-01,true,2 yrs,KPMG Australia,https://www.linkedin.com/company/2639873/,"Lead Partner Analytics: Strategy, Growth & Digital - Audit, Assurance & Risk Consulting",,"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",Apr 2022 - Jun 2022,2022-04-01,false,3 mos,"Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, USA",,Certified Fraud Examiner,,Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists ,,Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist,,"Risk Management, Financial Risk, Financial Modeling, SAS, Team Leadership, Data Analysis, Data Mining, Operational Risk, SQL, Business Analysis, People Development, Actuarial Science, Reinsurance, Insurance, Assets Recovery, Call Center, Analytics, Portfolio Management, Financial Services, Process Improvement, Banking, Change Management, Finance, Statistical Modeling, Strategy, Management, Leadership",Risk Management,41,Financial Risk,29,Financial Modeling,10,SAS,15,Team Leadership,3,Data Analysis,13,https://linkedin.com/in/jadonfox,jadonfox,2024-06-13T04:36:51.861Z,,,http://www.acfe.com/,,"https://www.acams.org/

Developing core analytical and technical skills has provided the tools to identify the key trends and patterns in data, predict future outcomes and visualise valuable insights. 

My focus has been to apply these capabilities to better understand customer behaviours, identify future journeys and interactions and quantify the value of the relationship overtime. 

Through the use of technology, integrated data and sophisticated cloud platforms, I have been able to scale and automate customer engagement and monitor the value of delivering highly targeted and personalised communications across multiple channels.  

My experience has allowed me to help organisations transform their customer capabilities to be more digitally enabled and make better data driven decisions. This transformation has also required the design of the functional Operating Model to optimise the people capabilities, prioritise initiatives, develop rigorous processes and the define how success will be measured. 

The management of operational delivery teams for both advanced analytics and customer campaigns has instilled in me the disciplines, processes and governance required to quickly develop and implement new customer insights and communications.

Critical to my successful delivery of business outcomes, has been the building of relationships at an executive level to influence and guide data, analytical and customer strategies, along with the development of the supporting cross-functional ways or working and organisational structures.",Experience Design | Emerging Technology | Personalisation | Data & Analytics | Digital Transformation | Business Value,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E03AQGHAlpvvAzaaQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_400_400/0/1517715072852?e=1723680000&v=beta&t=YfwoKL8Z2v5nUiLrW8ay0fWYUOY1rolMeLb0Pp1wy3U,Richard,Gilson,Richard Gilson,1305,2nd,ACoAAADdeBIB9Rpbh7f4t8wMnJKHkr08mXP6wgk,14514194,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAAADdeBIB9Rpbh7f4t8wMnJKHkr08mXP6wgk,name",1312,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAADdeBIB9Rpbh7f4t8wMnJKHkr08mXP6wgk%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAAADdeBIB9Rpbh7f4t8wMnJKHkr08mXP6wgk%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,false,false,false,EY,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1073/,Director,,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Mar 2022 - Present,2022-03-01,true,2 yrs 4 mos,KPMG Australia,https://www.linkedin.com/company/2639873/,Director,"Successfully leads large and complex projects for well-established organisations to deliver both Customer and Insight solutions, along with the design of the operational processes and capabilities required to optimise usage, realise value and deliver commercial business outcomes.

My vast experience combines an excellent technical grounding with a deep and strategic understanding of how the data value chain can drive tangible business outcomes.

I have always been fascinated with the evolution of information. I could see early on the power of data as an asset, and how it was going to shape the future. Following my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Information Systems, I really began to specialise in integrating and managing data »––> developing platforms, processes and the right policies to create a single source of truth that would enable organisations to improve their evidence based decision-making, and achieve their strategic objectives.

In recent previous roles I led data transformation and enterprise-wide data and analytics strategies from inception through to execution. I had executive-level oversight of various teams and projects across data governance, data management, and analytics. In my roles, I have enjoyed contributing on various project boards and committees, and have provided expert advice to executive leadership teams.

I am also passionate about selling the vision of data maturity for the future. I enjoy presenting and enabling others to see the status, value, and importance of data as an essential asset.

If organisations are going to succeed, they need to understand where they are at now, and plan for their future data needs.

The decisions and actions we take today will shape the way we live in the future...

Specifically, I have spent the last 4 years supporting and delivering the Defence ERP program in a variety of roles, primarily as a Project Manager and Business Architect within the program.

Other organisations I have worked for include EY, Santos and Hewlett Packard.

I have a keen interest in Project Management and Delivery in the IT sector, specifically within SAP and large scale implementations, to ultimately deliver benefits and outcomes to clients.

ICT initiatives are all about change, and inevitably that change impacts the users, internal and external and unless they (the who) understand the what, why, when, how, and where, your cannot have a successful outcome.

I am detailed oriented, value data and analysis in decision making and always have the bigger picture in mind (that's what all the tests, personality styles say about me).

I have been involved in almost every sort of ICT project and the ones that I have enjoyed the most and have felt a greater sense of accomplishment are those that make a real difference to the client and the intended audience. Playing a role in assisting deaf and hard of hearing students and the victims of family violence being two that come to mind. That said, purchasing hardware, developing solution options or migrating users still has to happen so that you have the capacity and capability to effect change.

I can recall working with WinWord 6 & Windows 3.1 and lots of floppy discs so I have been involved and engaged in IT for quite some time and still enjoy the challenges and rewards that come my way.

My primary ambition is to apply that passion and experience to the benefit of society and communities.

2. Large-scale technology implementation
3. IT operating model improvement

I achieved seniority by being promoted through the ranks, until being appointed as Managing Director (‘Partner’) at BearingPoint in 2007, at the age of 38. In 2009 I, with four fellow executives, was part of an MBO of BearingPoint’s business in Australia. In doing so I became a part-owner and Director of a $20million consulting business, which was acquired by a large China-based IT Services organisation in 2012.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-martin-nz/,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-martin-nz/,"With a comprehensive background in business and finance, I bring a strong foundation and expertise to contribute to the success of an organisation.  I have a keen eye for accuracy and precision, excelling in financial management and advisory roles, however my true passion lies in building genuine connections with people.  My high level of emotional intelligence, derived from valuable life experiences, allows me to establish lasting relationships.  By combining my keen sense of humour with strong interpersonal skills and business acumen, I create a positive and lasting impact on individuals and organisations alike.

As a Senior Manager & Advisor at KPMG, my focus is on supporting farming families in Canterbury and Otago, guiding them towards informed and confident business decisions.  I work closely with my clients to understand their financial and lifestyle objectives, and develop strategic roadmaps to achieve their desired outcomes.   Furthermore, I actively seek to attract and retain top talent within the KPMG team.  By providing guidance and implementing effective strategies, I aim to ensure a high performing and highly engaged team.

My professional journey has further been enriched by my 2-year tenure as a Risk Advisor at Pivot, where I specialised in personal risk plans, private insurance, and human capital wealth and business planning.  Prior to that, I spent 9 years as an Accountant, where I was responsible for financial statement compilation, tax returns, and budget & cash-flow forecasting.

Outside of work, I have actively contributed to my community by serving on three local not-for-profit Boards in the capacity of an Appointed Trustee, Independent Board Member and Finance Chair.   Through these roles, I have been able to make significant strategic contributions while leveraging my broader governance skills.

Personally, I thrive on challenges and am dedicated to achieving exceptional results in all aspects of my life – both professionally and personally.  I find great satisfaction in building new relationships, exploring growth opportunities, and making a meaningful impact on others' lives.

These include curriculum development, student engagement, project management, liaising with stakeholders, and working closely with a team of globally recognised architecture academics.  

My passion as an educator is split between two opposing realms: on one hand I am fascinated by new technology like GEN-AI tools and building immersive digital environments; while the other holds a deep love for fine craft, the act of making, and everyday beauty. In my teaching, we are currently exploring the boundaries of technology, craft and sustainability through digital fabrication in one unit, and interrogating the possibilities of game engines for real-time immersive environments in another. I am also integrating the use of artificial intelligence tools into our pedagogy to ensure creative, responsible and ethical use of these technologies.

In my research, I am exploring the mechanics of Awe in Architecture. Awe is a pathway to self-transcendence, and as such, is a positive emotion that leads to thinking collectively, rather than individually. It has also been shown to be correlated with lower rates of prejudice and higher rates of openness to diversity and inclusion. Or, as Dacher Keltner (2023), the preeminent expert on the subject says ""How can we live a good life? One enlivened by joy, community and meaning? Find Awe."" My research looks to better understand how awe and architecture collide and hopes to identify tangible pathways to eliciting awe for others through architecture. Here is a short, work-in-progress abstract:

Awe in architecture, or architecture that moves us has long been a topic of speculation and conjecture but remains largely theoretical and subjective. Many of us have experienced grand or awe-inspiring architecture, but how does it work? This research aims to quantify awe in architecture through comparative, quantitative analysis, exploring the objective contributors to emotional impact. Utilizing GEN-AI tools, participants, including architects and non-architects, will create transcendent architectural experiences. Virtual reality then facilitates immersion and biometric scanners measure emotional responses, providing data for objective analysis. This identifies consistent elements that evoke awe, clarifying the mechanics of uplifting architecture.",Course Coordinator of Architecture at Curtin University,Greater Perth Area,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D5603AQEN-PhCcczgQQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1709090279807?e=1724284800&v=beta&t=-lOmrsyU5yHc19EqLJxoPJhofTopL9FjDyEdcG36ILU,Chris,Mewburn,Chris Mewburn,540,3rd,ACoAADYr3UkB4wk110qwZgz1sZ06CLtyuOLra8s,908844361,"https://www.linkedin.com/sales/people/ACoAADYr3UkB4wk110qwZgz1sZ06CLtyuOLra8s,name",526,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAADYr3UkB4wk110qwZgz1sZ06CLtyuOLra8s%22%5D&facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%2C%22S%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH,https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetNetwork=%5B%22F%22%5D&facetConnectionOf=%5B%22ACoAADYr3UkB4wk110qwZgz1sZ06CLtyuOLra8s%22%5D&origin=MEMBER_PROFILE_CANNED_SEARCH&RESULT_TYPE=PEOPLE,false,false,false,Curtin University,https://www.linkedin.com/company/8788/,Course Coordinator,"I am honored to serve as the Course Coordinator for the Bachelor of Architecture at Curtin University.

She has more than 10 years of practical hands-on experience in data science across the entire life cycle from requirement gathering, design, analysis, build and test, all the way to deployment and maintenance in multiple environments.

Primary skills: machine learning, technical delivery, leadership, strategy and public speaking.

As a data science consultant, Aina spent the last 6 years leading the delivery of data science solutions to KPMG clients in financial services, federal and state (mostly NSW) government. These projects involved natural language processing and understanding, object classification and time series forecasting. In their work Aina also helps to shape data-informed business strategies and utilises agile scrum methodologies, cloud platforms and analytics to manage complex projects and stakeholders (including C-suite) and deliver business value with data.

Aina is a public speaker, presenting not only on data science but also workplace inclusion for underrepresented communities (women in STEM and LGBTQ+ people). In 2023, they were a Women in ICT Awards finalist for using data-driven approaches to empower underprivileged communities at work.

Prior to consulting, Aina spent five years in astrophysics research. She built supervised machine learning models to automatically classify celestial signals of unknown nature captured by space telescopes. Automating classification of celestial signals is a big current challenge in astronomy with telescopes capturing prodigious amounts of data that is impossible to process using traditional spectral analysis methods.

Before her data science career, Aina also developed back-end to the database-powered web applications in ColdFusion (similar to Java) for various retail organisations.

My studies have allowed me to fully realise the ‘magic’ that is mechanical engineering; the conversion of heat or light into mechanical energy, then into useful work, never fails to fascinate and inspire me to imagine new designs and useful machines. The effect these technologies have had in the past and their exponential development in the present only has me excited to discover what technologies the future holds.

By studying both Engineering and Computer Science, I hope to bridge the gap between mechanical machines and digital technology, especially so in regard to Artificial Intelligence and their suitability for future machines.

Every candidate is a potential game-changer, and the right one can elevate the entire organisation to new levels of success.  This is what recruiting is to me! 

At Canva, we're in an exciting phase of rapid growth and scaling. 🚀 As a Leadership Sorcerer, my focus is to proactively identify, engage, and convert high-caliber leadership talent. I collaborate closely with Talent Acquisition Partners and hiring managers to drive data-driven leadership sourcing, through executive search, strategic sourcing, and deep insights. By developing creative pipeline strategies and cultivating diverse talent pools, I aim to connect exceptional leaders with roles at Canva that align with their career aspirations. 

In my previous role at KPMG as a Talent Brand Specialist, I focused on innovation—creating impactful social media strategies and launching the ‘People Stories’ series. This initiative significantly enhanced our employer brand and talent acquisition strategy, attracting talent globally.

When I’m not sourcing talent, I’m making memories with my one-year-old boy, bouldering, running, or volunteering.

I have front-end experience in Angular, Tailwind CSS and various charting frameworks. Likewise, I have designed and built APIs using the .net Framework. Setting up various cloud infrastructure on the Azure cloud platform has also exposed me to configuring OAuth connections to various external APIs, via Azure to the various front end Angular sites. I am also proficient in CSS, HTML and SQL.

I really enjoy coding because it allows me to make full use of my problem solving skills, to collaborate, to be innovative and creative. It is also challenging, yet highly rewarding with a visible product as a result of my efforts.  I feel like I have made something. There is always more to learn and I enjoy learning.

I have a keen eye for detail and this has allowed me to succeed in multiple industries.

My current role as a Project Manager delivering HCM via Workday is exactly one of those opportunities to transform a business.

In my current role I focus on continuous improvement of processes and systems from a business perspective. My goal is to drive business forward by making information available to everyone, wherever they are, whenever they need it, on which ever device, and to simplify the way they work.

While I enjoy all aspects of my job, I think my favourite stage of a project is working with the business to understand their objectives and providing a way to deliver on those objectives.

I’ve worn many hats in my career, analyst, specialist, and leader and as a result, I have a unique ability to manage different projects and to navigate complex challenges. But actual experience has taught me that my professional value boils down to the following:

-	My colleagues knows me a strategic thinker who can always be trusted to come up with a new approach 
-	I follow through on implementation
-	I continuously seeking out industry leaders to see what is next
-	I have big ideas
-	I have courage
-	I like to dive in to solve issues 
-	I constantly look for the next challenge

In my spare time I love travelling the world and eating my way through the places I visit. I probably search for the restaurants first before I make the final travel decision.

In Transactions Assurance, I work closely with clients to provide assurance over historical financial information for IPOs and Mergers & Acquisitions. I have also gained valuable experience in management consulting as an intern at Oxygy, where I facilitated the IT transition of a blue-chip company, delivering solutions that improved efficiency.

My passion for finance and learning led me to pursue a Master's degree in Finance from ESADE Business & Law School, where I acquired a solid foundation in financial analysis, valuation, and asset management. I also participated in an international study tour at the London School of Economics and Political Science, expanding my global perspective and network. Additionally, I have passed Level I of the CFA Program and I am a candidate for CA from ICAS, demonstrating my commitment and dedication to the field.

I am always eager to explore new opportunities and challenges, as evidenced by my previous entrepreneurial ventures, such as co-founding Theiah Pakistan, a social enterprise that won the Hult Prize Pakistan National Event in 2017, and serving as a student consultant at Axelerate Consulting, providing strategic advice to SMEs and NGOs.

The bank wished to review the program and provide observations and recommendations on execution of this strategy and progress of the program. Hollowed-out functionality included capabilities such as Product & Pricing and Customer Mastering, which were being progressively removed from the target core banking system and replaced with a series of best of breed, often cloud based, software services coupled with new integrations and microservices.  
While this hollow-out strategy is often viewed as lower risk than a full replacement system, it is still an enormous and complex undertaking which generates a different set of high-risk considerations.
Graeme led the review which took ~6 weeks with some 50+ interviews and associated fact-finding activities.  A draft review report was prepared for factual clearance, and a final report presented to executive stake-holders.","Melbourne, Victoria, Australia · Hybrid",Mar 2023 - May 2023,2023-03-01,false,3 mos,,,,,,,,,"Strategy, IT Transformation, Financial Services, Core Banking, Governance, IT Strategy, IT Service Management, Banking, Business Process, Business Analysis, Business Process Improvement, Business Transformation, Business Requirements, Change Management, IT Audit, Data Warehousing, Management, PMO, Management Consulting, Program Management, Project Delivery, Project Planning, Project Management",Strategy,,IT Transformation,,Financial Services,17,Core Banking,15,Governance,16,IT Strategy,23,https://linkedin.com/in/graeme-stephens-18b9a26,graeme-stephens-18b9a26,2024-06-20T04:10:27.401Z,,,,,,,,,"Dave Miller, Sam Dale, and 1 other mutual connection",,,

I am back as a private engineering consultant, but this time it's my own business!  Steve Tucker Consulting is the culmination of over a quarter-of-a-century of experience in the Transport, Mining, Aerospace, and Defence sectors.

I'm a highly credentialed Engineer, Chartered in four Areas of Practice, and use this experience to advise Program Directors, Chief Engineers, Regulators and other stakeholders of industry.

I spent the first 20 years of my career working as a Software and Systems Engineer in Rail Operations for Passenger (Queensland Rail), Freight/Bulk (Aurizon), and Light-rail (Gold Coast Light Rail).  With 2 decades of software and systems design, operations modelling, development, integration, deployment, operations and maintenance on my resume, I transitioned into the role of engineering advisor.

In those years as an advisor, in the Queensland market, I consulted at Boeing as the Lead Software and Systems Engineer on the deployment and assurance of a prototype UAV situational awareness system.  I then consulted on the Next Generation Ticketing Solution for the Queensland Government, firstly helping to develop early-project engineering plans, and then providing engineering assurance for the government department overseeing the multi-stage, multi-modal, multi-year project.

Outside of Queensland, as the Transport Engineering Lead at KPMG, I advised on projects such as the Melbourne Airport Rail, Sydney Metro, BHP's Rail System in the Pilbara, Inland Rail and ARTC's Advanced Train Management System (ATMS).

Potential home buyers need to be confident that the current septic tank / off-mains system is compliant with the latest Environment Agency General Binding Rules.

A normal survey won't go into detail when a property has been identified as ""off-mains"", they will suggest that the buyer seeks further expert advice.

• Ward Environmental Services is a specialist independent consultancy with over 30 years of industry experience in “off mains” drainage.
• We offer expert advice and guidance for Estate & Land Agents, home buyers and vendors that are involved with properties that are “off mains”.
• We can provide help and advice for you and your clients with a fixed fee home buyer’s or seller’s survey (£250 + VAT) to ensure compliance to Environment Agency regulations

In addition, we also offer the following services:

• Site survey / inspection to identify the type of system
• Tailored design and specification of new systems
• On-site supervision of clients’ own builder or ground-worker
• Complete turn-key supply and installation service

These positions followed a successful career at Rabobank in a variety of roles in agricultural financing and investment.  With broad expertise and knowledge developed in this area, my senior leadership and mentoring capabilities also evolved across both branch and regional portfolio management.

I have also built wide-ranging engagement skills at all levels from on farm through to Federal Government and was trusted to provide counsel and representation into matters relating to Federal agricultural policy. 

The passion I have for rural industries originated growing up on a mixed grazing farm in Southern New South Wales and was enhanced when I graduated with Honours in a Bachelor of Agricultural Economics at the University of Sydney.

I am an experienced and certified Solution Architect in the Microsoft Power Platform and can give you value through building custom business apps using Dynamics 365 CE, Power Platform, Power Automate, Power BI and Power Apps.  I love working with stakeholders in a business analyst and solution architect capacity and I really enjoy blending new concepts in thought leadership, practice management, ethics, moral philosophy and deep critical thinking to my roles and projects. I am also experienced with Microsoft Power BI and a Professional Scrum Master.

I have additional responsibilities in the people and culture aspects of the practice including managing performance and development of junior staff and assisting with recruitment and on-boarding of new staff including graduates.
